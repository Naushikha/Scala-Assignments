For each Rs. 5 increment of price, attendance decreases by 20 and vice versa
20/5 = 4
Thus we can assume for each rupee of increment attendence decreases by 4  and vice versa

Let ticket price,
= p + c 
[ where p is the given price and c is the unit change of price, positive or negative]
e.g. - Rs. 15 -> positive unit change = Rs. 16 -> negative unit change = Rs. 14

Let attendance,
= a - 5c 
[ where a is the given attendance and 5c is the reduction/ addition of people based on price change ]

Then the profit,
= ticket price * attendance - performance cost - cost per attendee * attendance
= (p + c) * (a - 5c) - 500 - 3 * (a - 5c)
By simplifying expression,
= (ap - 3a - 500) - [5c^2 + (5p - a - 15)c]

The changing variable is c and a and p are constants.
Thus the goal is to find the minimum value for the expression,
[5c^2 + (5p - a - 15)c]
This is a quadratic equation with a minima.
The solution is found when the value of c at the vertex of its parabola is found.
This can be found by,
c = -(5p - a - 15) / 10
